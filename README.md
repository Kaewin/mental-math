THis is a program I wrote to accompany the book Secrets Of Mental Math by Arthur Benjamin. 

See [this link](https://a.co/d/1N0z9D9) for the book on Amazon.

This program gives you practice problems for each of the categories.

I first wrote this when I was a kid for both programming practice and mental math practice. I have filled in everything to the place I was at before.

More will be added as I go along
